# Manual Setup Required 🔧

Due to GitHub App permission limitations, some files need to be created manually to complete the production setup.

## 🚨 Required Manual Actions

### 1. Create GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline configuration is ready but needs manual creation:

**File to create**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Source**: Copy content from `CICD_SETUP.md`

**Steps**:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Create `.github/workflows/` directory
3. Create `ci.yml` file with content from `CICD_SETUP.md`
4. Commit the file

This will enable:
- ✅ Multi-Python version testing (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- ✅ Security scanning (Bandit, Safety, Pip-audit)  
- ✅ Performance benchmarking
- ✅ Automated package building
- ✅ Integration testing
- ✅ Docker image building
- ✅ PyPI publishing (on release)
- ✅ Documentation deployment

### 2. Repository Configuration

Configure repository settings for full functionality:

**GitHub Pages**:
- Go to Settings > Pages
- Set source to "Deploy from a branch"  
- Select `gh-pages` branch (will be created by CI)

**Branch Protection** (recommended):
- Go to Settings > Branches
- Add rule for `main` branch
- Enable "Require status checks to pass"
- Select all CI checks

**Secrets** (if publishing):
- Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
- Add `PYPI_API_TOKEN` for PyPI publishing
- Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` for coverage reporting (optional)

### 3. Pre-commit Setup (for contributors)

Contributors should run:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## ✅ What's Already Complete

The autonomous SDLC execution has delivered:

### 🏗️ Complete Architecture

## 🎯 Validation Commands

Test the complete system locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install-dev

# Run all quality gates
make ci-test

# Test core functionality
make health-check

# Build Docker image
docker build -t phd-notebook .

# Run integration test
docker run --rm phd-notebook python -c "import phd_notebook; print('✅ Production ready!')"
```

## 🎉 Final Status
