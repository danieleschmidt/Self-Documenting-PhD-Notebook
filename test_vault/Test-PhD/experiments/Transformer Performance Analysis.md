# Transformer Performance Analysis

## Hypothesis
Transformers will outperform RNNs on sequence tasks

## Experimental Design
Comparative study testing multiple conditions

## Methodology
1. Define clear research question and hypothesis
2. Identify independent and dependent variables
3. Design experimental protocol
4. Prepare materials and setup
5. Conduct pilot test if necessary
6. Execute main experiment
7. Collect and record data systematically
8. Analyze results using appropriate statistical methods

## Materials Needed
- Data collection instruments/tools
- Recording equipment (digital/paper)
- Statistical analysis software
- Backup storage for data
- Comparison materials/conditions

## Data Collection Plan
**Method**: Systematic measurement and recording
**Frequency**: Regular intervals as appropriate
**Tools**: Standardized instruments when possible
**Quality Control**: Regular calibration and validation checks

## Timeline
- **Planning**: 1-2 weeks
- **Execution**: 2-3 weeks
- **Analysis**: 1-2 weeks

## Potential Challenges
- Sample size limitations
- Measurement accuracy
- External factors/confounding variables
- Time and resource constraints
- Fair comparison conditions
- Baseline differences

## Success Metrics
- Statistical significance (p < 0.05)
- Practical significance (effect size)
- Reproducibility of results
- Achievement of research objectives
