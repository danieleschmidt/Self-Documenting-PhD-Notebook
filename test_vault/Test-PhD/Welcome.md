# Welcome to Your Research Vault ðŸŽ“

This is your self-documenting PhD notebook! Here's how to get started:

## Quick Start
1. Create daily notes in the `daily/` folder
2. Document experiments in `experiments/`
3. Save literature reviews in `literature/`
4. Track project progress in `projects/`

## Folder Structure
- **daily/**: Daily research notes and logs
- **projects/**: Major research projects
- **experiments/**: Experimental procedures and results
- **literature/**: Paper reviews and summaries
- **ideas/**: Research ideas and hypotheses
- **meetings/**: Meeting notes and discussions
- **templates/**: Note templates for different types
- **attachments/**: Images, PDFs, and other files

## Templates Available
- [[templates/experiment]]: For documenting experiments
- [[templates/literature]]: For paper reviews
- [[templates/meeting]]: For meeting notes

## Tips
- Use `[[double brackets]]` to link between notes
- Add `#tags` to categorize your notes
- Use the graph view to visualize connections
- Daily notes help track progress over time
